    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Implemented dual-mode scheduler to schedule commands and manage access based on priority and timing.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 301

    Summary       : Enable inactivity timeout feature when RAT channels are also used
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Previously inactivity timeout and subsequent power down happens only when the no RAT is active.
                    Added logic to start inactivity timeout after the all the RAT channel are disabled.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 493

    Summary       : No need to call RFCRTrim every time wake up
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Previously RFCRTrim is called every time during wakeup. Changed to only call RFCRtrim in the first
                    powerup and whenever requested by the user for setup update through RF_control.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 518

    Summary       : Start using analogCfgMode in powerup to reduce powerup time
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Set analogCfgMode in setup command to 0x0 in the first powerup and whenever requested by the user
                    for setup update through RF_control; otherwise set analogCfgMode to 0x2D to reduce powerup time.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 544

    Summary       : Configuring powerup duration margin
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Powerup duration margin can be configured through RF_params during RF_open or through RF_control
                    afterwards. If not configured by the user default value will be used.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 552

    Summary       : Set the bNoFsPowerUp in the RF_SetupCmd to 0
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : During powerup, set the bNoFsPowerUp in the RF_Setup command to 0 before sending it to the radio
                    doorbell.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 574

    Summary       : Default error callback for recoverable errors
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : When user doesn't register error callback function during RF_open, for recoverable errors such as
                    ERROR_SYNTH_PROG from CMD_FS, the defaultErrCb is not used to avoid stuck in while(1) in the
                    defaultErrCb function.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 492

    Summary       : Faulty RF_Stat enum
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Rearranged order of RF_Stat enumerations such that success stats are below 0x80, and error stats are
                    0x80 and above.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 494

    Summary       : RF driver calling callback with e = null
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : When two CPE interrupts are very close, as soon as first interrupt processing Swi begins, the second
                    Hwi happens, and the event flag set by the second Hwi is cleared by the first processing Swi, resulted
                    in the second Swi to call callback with zero event flag. Changed to do the flag clear as early as possible
                    in critical section to mitigate this issue.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 495

    Summary       : RF_RadioSetup missing rfc_CMD_PROP_RADIO_DIV_SETUP_t
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added rfc_CMD_PROP_RADIO_DIV_SETUP_t into the RF_RadioSetup union.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 505

    Summary       : RF_postCmd() cannot cancel RF_yield if there is a pending command
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added cancellation of RF_yield when commands are pending.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 513

    Summary       : bRestart should be set in critical section
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Moved setting bRestart into critical section.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 516

    Summary       : Accessing RAT when RF Core is powered down
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : If RF is powered down without using RF_yield, such as inactivity timeout or future command, accessing
                    RAT may cause crash, since ratChanAlloc is trying to access RFDBELL register (IEN). Added check if
                    radio is active when accessing RAT.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 519

    Summary       : RF driver is getting stuck when Clock.tickPeriod is too high
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Timeout computation for Clock may round down to 0, and this happens more likely when Clock.tickPeriod
                    is high. Added round down bound to 1 so that Clock timeout is always greater than or equal to 1.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 528

    Summary       : bPowerChangePhy check in RF_scheduleCmd is not done properly
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : bPowerChangePhy check in RF_scheduleCmd is not done properly. Added additional check in RF_scheduleCmd
                    when posting events when command is requested.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 532

    Summary       : Clear flag and cleanup flag check after a cancelled command callback
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Changed to clear the flag after the callback is returned in fsmActiveState function.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 554

    Summary       : Need to reset bYieldPwrDnCancel when switching PHY
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : The flag bYieldPwrDnCancel is set after RF_yield is called to power down, but another RF_postCmd is called
                    before the actual power down state is executed. The flag is reset when the state machine executes the power
                    down event. In dual mode, this flag must also be reset when switching PHY.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 573

    Summary       : nRtc1 is reset every time powerup sequence is complete
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : nRtc1 was reset every time powerup sequence is complete in order to compute nPowerupDuration for every cycle.
                    This causes problem in active time accumulation for sending CMD_SYNC_STOP_RAT during power down. Moved reset
                    nRtc1 to the beginning of powerdown.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 380

    Summary       : UART_readCancel() should always turn off receiver even if there's no active read ongoing
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : UART
    Release Notes : Updated to disable UART receiver and release power constraints whenever UART_readCancel is called.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 390

    Summary       : CC13xx UART HW RX Buffer overrun
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : UART
    Release Notes : Added RingBuffer for UART RX.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 384

    Summary       : Bug in PINCC26XX PIN Driver causes glitches on IO output in given scenarios
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PIN
    Release Notes : In PINCC26XX_setIoCfg(), if pin's GPIO_O_DOE is enabled, skip setting the output value.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 537

    Summary       : CryptoCC26XX_loadKey pends transSem with BIOS_NO_WAIT
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : CRYPTO
    Release Notes : CryptoCC26XX_loadKey used to immediately return with a failure code if there was another transaction going on.
                    It now blocks until the crypto module is available.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 542

    Summary       : SPI driver tries to dereference NULL pointer in SPICC26XXDMA_csnCallback()
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : SPI
    Release Notes : The SPICC26XXDMA_csnCallback() function writes to the status field of currentTransaction.
                    However, prior to SPICC26XXDMA_csnCallback() being called (when the chip select is deasserted by the host)
                    the SPICC26XXDMA_swiFxn() sets the currentTransaction field to NULL.
                    The driver tries to write to address 0 and triggers a bus fault.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 524

    Summary       : UDMACC26XX.h generates assignement errors when compiled with C++
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : DMA
    Release Notes : The UDMACC26XX.h header file contains several inline functions. They contain code that implicitly typecasts from
                    void * (handle->hwAttrs or handle->object) to either UDMACC26XX_HWAttrs * or UDMACC26XX_Object *. This implicit
                    typecasting is not allowed in C++, but is allowed in C.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 520

    Summary       : PWMled example does not run correctly on several 26xx/13xx boards
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PWM
    Release Notes : The default PWMled example blinks two LEDs. The CC1310STK only has one LED. The PIN_open call consequently fails at runtime.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 551

    Summary       : Improved CCM documentation in crypto driver
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : CRYPTO
    Release Notes : There was previously no documentation on how to use the CCM mode in the crypto driver.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 589

    Summary       : Reduced code footprint of crypto driver by consolidating CryptoCC26XX_transact and CryptoCC26XX_transactPolling
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : CRYPTO
    Release Notes : CryptoCC26XX_transact and CryptoCC26XX_transactPolling contained a large amount of duplicate code. Their functionality was
                    combined in a static function that takes one more parameter.
                    CryptoCC26XX_transact and CryptoCC26XX_transactPolling remain as passthrough functions to the combined implementation.
                    The API for CryptoCC26XX_transact and CryptoCC26XX_transactPolling thus remains unchanged.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 510

    Summary       : Move SysCtrl_DCDC_VoltageConditionalControl() to before entering standby
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : POWER
    Release Notes : SysCtrl_DCDC_VoltageConditionalControl() is called after coming out of standby to turn off the DCDC if the battery voltage
                    has dropped below 2.25 V (limit set in ccfg). However it may take a long time after coming out of standby until batmon
                    reports correct battery voltage, as a result SysCtrl_DCDC_VoltageConditionalControl() should be called before entering standby.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 399

    Summary       : keySrc parameter to CryptoCC26XX_allocateKey() function should be allowed to be NULL
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Crypto
    Release Notes : CryptoCC26XX_allocateKey() may now explicitely called with keySrc == NULL to reserve a
                    key store index without having a key at that time. The key may later be set using
                    CryptoCC26XX_loadKey().
    Workaround    : N/A


Item 187

    Summary       : Switch-statements have no default case in PowerCC2650_calibrateRCOSC.c
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Power
    Release Notes : All switch statements need default cases. Those in PowerCC2650_calibrateRCOSC.c now call
                    a lightweight abort function. The default case should never trigger in practice.

    Summary       : Replaced while(1) with user error callback
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added error callback when RF core error occurs. The error callback function is passed from
                    user through RF_Params in RF_open. This replaces earlier implementation of while(1) loop.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 270

    Summary       : Added power up callback
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF

    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added RF_scheduleCmd API to schedule a radio operations command. This API is backward compatible with
                    RF_postCmd API which is a special case of scheduling a command.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 328

    Summary       : Added placeholder RF_requestAccess API
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF

    Workaround    : N/A

Item 353

    Summary       : Added RF dual mode PHY switching mechanism
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added RF PHY switching mechanism for dual mode, so that RF operation is changed from one mode to the
                    other without having to power down the RF.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 421

    Summary       : Fixed power down issue when RF_yield is called
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : When RF_yield is called to power down the radio, if another radio command is posted before the actual
                    power down process started, RF may get stuck. Fixed by canceling the power down process if this occurs.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 435

    Summary       : Fixed possible overwrtiting command pool entries
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : RF command pool buffer was allocated sequentially regardless of command is pending or not. This resulted
                    in possible overwrting of command pool entries when existing commands are cancelled. Implemented linked
                    list for the command pool to fix the issue.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 438

    Summary       : Fixed inadvertently enabling RF_EventMdmSoft when enabling RF_EventInternalError
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : RF_EventInternalError was defined as (1<<31) but the event is 64-bit. When extending to 64-bit, the compiler
                    treat it as a signed integer and sign extension to all 1's. This inadvertently enabled unwanted bits. Fixed
                    by defining as (uint32)(1<<31).
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 468

    Summary       : CC13xx PG2.1 calibration issue handling

Item 349

    Summary       : g_hwiInt in crypto API should be declared as volatile
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : Crypto
    Release Notes : g_hwiInt is a flag set to false in CryptoCC26XX_transactPolling(…) before the encryption is started, and then we wait for this flag to be set to true in the ISR.
                    his must obviously be volatile, to ensure the polling loop always reads this variable from memory (ensuring the compiler does not optimize these lines of code by caching the variable in a register).
    Workaround    : N/A

Item  404

    Summary       : PDM driver decimationFilterInRAM larger than necessary
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : decimationFilterInRAM was declared as:
                    static int32_t decimationFilterInRAM[sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs)];
                    when it should have been:
                    static int32_t decimationFilterInRAM[sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs) / sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs[0])];

                    The problem was that it specified decimationFilterInRAM to contain as many int32_t's as there are bytes in the PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs array.
                    Later in the code, PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs is copied into decimationFilterInRAM. It is obvious they should have been be the same size.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 383

    Summary       : Fixed a bug that prevented switching CSN in SPI master mode
    Severity      : Major

Item 181

    Summary       : Workaround for crypto reentrancy issue
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Crypto
    Release Notes : Stress testing the crypto driver has identified an issue where
                    if the crypto driver is preempted by another higher priority HWI or SWI,
                    the crypto driver might not complete the encryption/decryption operation.
                    The workaround is to disable HWI interrupts while the crypto hardware is
                    configured. Depending on the mode of operation, interrupts are disabled
                    typically for approximately 10 us.
                    Work is ongoing to find a better solution for this issue.
    Workaround    : Add Hwi_disable()/Hwi_restore() around these functions:
                    - CRYPTOCcmAuthEncrypt(...)
                    - CRYPTOCcmInvAuthDecrypt(...)
                    - CRYPTOAesEcb(...)

    Summary       : RCOSC_HF calibration check within a range to avoid likelyhood of 2 TDC measurements
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Power
    Release Notes : The RCOSC_HF oscillator calibration algorithm does the following steps:
                    1. Measure RCOSC_HF frequency using the XOSC_HF as reference clock.
                    2. If the RCOSC_HF frequency is a perfect 48 MHz, algorithm is done.
                    3. If the RCOSC_HF frequency is NOT a perfect 48 MHz, it modifies the RCOSC_HF frequency and
                      performes another frequency measurement.
                      If the new frequency is closer to 48 MHz these new settings are kept.
                      If the new frequency is further away from 48 MHz, the settings are reverted
                      to the settings used during the first measurement.

                    The check for exactly 48 MHz in step 2 is too strict, and as a result the
                    algorithm will perform two measurements most of the time.
                    The new check for exactly 48 MHz includes a small range, which will reduce the
                    likelyhood of doing another frequency measurement, while still ensuring
                    exact 48 MHz frequency and thus fast XOSC_HF startup.
                    Doing only 1 RCOSC_HF frequency instead of 2 measurements saves power.
    Workaround    : See PowerCC26XX_calibrateRCOSC.c for implementation details.


Item 349

    Summary       : g_hwiInt in crypto API should be declared as volatile
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Crypto
    Release Notes : When the CryptoCC26XX_transactPolling(...) API is called, this function
                    polls the g_hwiInt flag which is set to true in the HWI handler.
                    This flag must be declared as volatile to ensure the compiler does
                    not optimize this piece of code.
                    Declaring this flag as volatile ensures the variable is read from RAM
                    every time and not from an internal CPU scratch register.
    Workaround    : Declare g_hwiInt as volatile


Item 355

    Summary       : DisplayDogm1286 returns handle even if SPI_open() fails
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Display
    Release Notes : DisplayDogm1286 returns handle even if SPI_open() fails because
                    the PINs were already allocated.
                    In the new implementation DisplayDogm1286_open(...) now returns NULL
                    if opening the underlying SPI driver failed.
    Workaround    : Add this code to the end of DisplayDogm1286_open(...):
                    if (object->hLcd)
                    {
                        LCD_bufferClear(object->hLcd, 0);
                        LCD_update(object->hLcd, 0);
                        return hDisplay;
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        PIN_close(object->hPins);

Item 365

    Summary       : Increased PDM task stack size to support all error scenarios
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : If the PDM driver exhausts the heap, the PDM driver task will enter the
                    execution path where it uses the most stack. It will begin throwing away audio
                    samples until there is memory available on the heap again.
                    When compiled with CCS, the old task stack size of 400 was insufficient
                    and the stack would overflow in this scenario.
                    Therefore the stack size has been increased to 500 bytes to avoid stack overflow.
    Workaround    : Increase stack size to 500 bytes.

Item 382

    Summary       : Support for changing between HW and SW controlled CSn in SPI driver
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : It's now possible to switch between HW and SW controlled CSn in the SPI driver.
                    Some designes have multiple SPI slaves connected to the same SPI master,
                    with different CSn signals. Some of these SPI slaves are compatible with the
                    SPI hardware chip select modes, while some slaves require manual software operation
                    of chip select.
                    By calling SPICC26XXDMA_control(...) with cmd = SPICC26XXDMA_CMD_SET_CSN_PIN and
                    arg = PIN_UNASSIGNED, this will deallocate the CSn pin and allow the application
                    to control it through software.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 383

    Summary       : Changing CSn only worked in SPI slave mode
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : SPI
    Release Notes : By calling SPICC26XXDMA_control(...) with cmd = SPICC26XXDMA_CMD_SET_CSN_PIN the
                    old implementation would only work in SPI slave mode.
                    The new implementation also works when the CC26xx/CC13xx is SPI master.
    Workaround    : Add the following code in the SPICC26XXDMA_CMD_SET_CSN_PIN case:
                    /* Get the new CSN pin */
                    pinId = (PIN_Id)((*(PIN_Id *) arg));
                    /* Configure CSN pin and remap PIN_ID to new CSN pin specified by arg */
                    if (object->mode == SPI_SLAVE) {
                        pinConfig = PIN_INPUT_EN | PIN_PULLUP | pinId;
                    }
                    else {
                        pinConfig = PIN_GPIO_OUTPUT_EN | PIN_GPIO_HIGH | PIN_PUSHPULL | PIN_INPUT_DIS | PIN_DRVSTR_MED | pinId;
                    }

Item 404

    Summary       : PDM driver decimation filter optimization
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : The old implementation incorrectly declared:
                    static int32_t decimationFilterInRAM[sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs)];
                    This declaration was functionally correct, however
                    it wasted houndreds of bytes of RAM.
                    The new implementation correctly declares the decimation array as:
                    static int32_t decimationFilterInRAM[sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs) / sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs[0])];
    Workaround    : Declare decimationFilterInRAM as:
                    static int32_t decimationFilterInRAM[sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs) / sizeof(PDMCC26XX_aBqCoeffs[0])];

    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Use FCFG RTRIM if this is higher than what is provided. Fixed by updating the override list
                    by calling RFCRTrim function in driverlib before sending RF_RadioSetup command.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 184

    Summary       : Incorrect RAT timer count after waking up from RF_yield()
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : RAT timer count is incorrect if CMD_SYNC_STOP_RAT is not executed. Fixed by forcing a CMD_SYNC_STOP_RAT
                    command during the first power cycle.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 193

    Summary       : Posting Commands Rapidly When Using nInactivityTimeout of Zero

    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : In certain timing conditions the radio restart is incorrectly set causing problems in RF power up/down sequence. Fixed
                    by removing the restart scenario and clean-up of the power up/down sequence.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 308

    Summary       : RF_postCmd may cause Q_push to get stuck during overflow case
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : The RF_postCmd API wrap-around check is insufficient when the RF command queue is overflowed.
                    Fixed by correcting the wraparound check and also added additional checks in the Q_push.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 314

    Summary       : Radio failed to wake up after long time when using RF_yield
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : A problem in the RF_yield API which incorrectly started a power-down sequence while active command
                    is running. Resolved by correcting the power-down initiate checks in RF_yield API.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 324

    Summary       : Call to RF_getCurrentTime can cause illegal register access
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : There was a race condition when RAT register is read when using RF_getCurrentTime API while RF Core is powering down.
                    Fixed by adding critical section protection.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 337

    Summary       : Radio failed to wake up when RF_postCmd API is called in certain RF power-down state
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : After RF_yield API is called then another command is posted in SWI context before actual power-down sequence started.
                    This causes the next powerup cycle to fail. Fixed by cancelling the yield event if a new command is posted.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 340

    Summary       : Callback function sanity check
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Callback function NULL check was only done to the callback function itself, but if the callback function is in
                    a NULL structure it may result in invalid function address. Fixed by doing both NULL structure and NULL callback
                    function check.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 359

    Summary       : RAT timer callback is missing sometimes
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Since RAT timer SWI clears hwIntEvent after RAT timer callback function, in case new RAT timer HWI happens within
                    the RAT timer callback, the new RAT timer callback will be lost because after callback, the SWI will clear the
                    hwIntEvent. Fixed by changing the order of RAT callback and hwIntEvent clear sequence.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 362

    Summary       : Critical section protection during a pending queue push
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : During a pending queue push in RF_postCmd API, if an interrupt occurs and updates the queue it may cause problem to
                    the queue. Fixed by adding critical section protection in RF_postCmd API when using Q_push.
    Workaround    : N/A

    Summary       : Incorrect powerup duration measurement when using SYSRESET
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Different timing from SYSRESET as compared to cold reset caused incorrect powerup duration measurement. Fixed by
                    not doing measurement in the first powerup cycle

2. Bug Item Details
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 367, 368, 363

    Summary       : Any part of PDMCC26XX_open failing causes the function to continue instead of returning NULL
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : PDMCC26XX_open runs several operations that could fail and should cause a rollback of the
                    initialisation and the function to return NULL. It just "silently" fails and the driver
                    proceeds to operate in an undefined state.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 379

    Summary       : PDM driver throwAwayCount underflows with full heap
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : If the PDMCC26XX_Params.retBufSizeInBytes < 64 and the heap is full,
                    throwAwayCount underflows and is set to a huge number. This results in
                    the driver seemingly stalling, while in fact it is working off the huge
                    throwAwayCount.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 346

    Summary       : There is a memory leak when opening and then closing the PDM driver
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : activePcmBuffer is not freed upon calling PDMCC26XX_close but is allocated
                    in PDMCC26XX_open. This leads to a memory leak when repeatedly calling them
                    in order.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 339

    Summary       : There is distortion in the signal after calling PDMCC26XX_startStream
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : The first few samples of the signal after calling PCMCC26XX_startStream
                    have a significant amount of distortion in them.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 340

    Summary       : PDMCC26XX_Params.startupDelayWithClockInSamples only applied the first time PDMCC26XX_startStream is called
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : PDMCC26XX_Params.startupDelayWithClockInSamples only applied the first time PDMCC26XX_startStream is called.
                    It is now applied each time PDMCC26XX_startStream is called.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 358

    Summary       : PDM driver tries to free a NULL pointer in PDMCC26XX_close if the heap was filled previously and a memory allocation failed
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : If the heap is full while the PDM driver is streaming, a temporary buffer can fail to be allocated and the returned pointer is consequently NULL.
                    PDMCC26XX_close tries to free this buffer. Freeing a NULL pointer is not a great idea.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 363

    Summary       : Trying to call PDMCC26XX_open with a full heap causes the driver to run with an inconsistent internal state
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : PDMCC26XX_open doesn't fail and return NULL if the memory allocations in it fail. This causes the PDM task to be run with an
                    uninitialised buffer that will eventually be written to, causing a bus fault.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 366

    Summary       : PDMCC26XX_close can cause an inconsistent internal state due to asynchonous deallocation of memory in PDMCC26XX_close
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDMCC26XX_close can be called asynchronously by the application task w.r.t. the PDM task. PDMCC26XX_close deallocates a buffer used
                    in the PDM task. Doing this asynchronously can lead to an undefined state in the PDM task. PDMCC26XX_close now only posts an event
                    that causes the PDM task to shut down gracefully and synchronously.
    Release Notes : PDMCC26XX_close
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 350

    Summary       : I2C driver should release SB_DISALLOW constraint if bus is busy in blocking mode
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : I2C
    Release Notes : Added SB_DISALLOW constraint release when I2C write failed in blocking mode
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 354

    Summary       : RF_INTERNAL_IFG_MASK should be 0xFFFFFFFF6000100E
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Changed RF_INTERNAL_IFG_MASK to 0xFFFFFFFF6000100E
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 360

    Summary       : RF Driver does not handle simultaneous interrupts from RAT channels 6 and 7
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added processing of simultaneous RAT interrupts
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 365

    Summary       : RF driver can get stuck for chained commands with loops
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added count limit to avoid code get stuck in chained commands with loops
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 372

    Summary       : RF_close(): nSeqPost check is incorrect
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Corrected nSeqPost check in RF_close()
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 380

    Summary       : Unable to handle ISR's correctly and deterministically
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Added interrupt flag preservation and critical section protection
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 410

    Summary       : Reset bYielded variable in restart case
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Reset bYielded variable when RF command is posted
    Workaround    : N/A

    Affected Comp : SPI
    Release Notes : If both SPI modules are in use, and one finishes while
                    the other is still ongoing, it will release the
                    SB_DISALLOW constraint, thus causing the ongoing
                    SPI module transfer to erronously abort.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 195

    Summary       : RCOSC_HF calibration routine improved

Item 323

    Summary       : RCOSC calibration routine leaves TDC_DONE interrupt enabled after finishing
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : Power
    Release Notes : The RCOSC calibration routine running on the CM3 did not disable
                    the TDC_DONE interrupt after the RCOSC calibration routine was finished.
                    As a result, if the sensor controller would use the TDC afterwards
                    spurious interrupts to the CM3 would be generated thus confusing the
                    RCOSC calibration routine.
    Workaround    : Add this code snippet in Power_doCalibrate() function case STEP_CLEANUP_2
                    HWREG(AUX_EVCTL_BASE + AUX_EVCTL_O_COMBEVTOMCUMASK) = 0;

Item 326

    Summary       : RCOSC calibration routine releases TDC semaphore before the TDC
                    reference clock request is released
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Power
    Release Notes : The RCOSC calibration routine should release the TDC reference clock
                    before releasing the TDC semaphore.
    Workaround    : Add this code snippet in Power_doCalibrate() function case STEP_CLEANUP_1
                    HWREG(AUX_WUC_BASE + AUX_WUC_O_REFCLKCTL) = 0;
                    Add this code snippet in PowerCC26XX_RCOSC_clockFunc() function case STEP_CLEANUP_2
                    /* finish wait for AUX_WUC:REFCLKCTL.ACK to be cleared ... */
                    while(HWREG(AUX_WUC_BASE + AUX_WUC_O_REFCLKCTL) & AUX_WUC_REFCLKCTL_ACK);

Item 343

    Summary       : I2C driver should not set SB_DISALLOW constraint in a binary fashion
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : I2C
    Release Notes : If the I2C driver handle is shared between multiple tasks,
                    the SB_DISALLOW constraint will be released when the first transfer completes.
                    This leads to subsequent transfers failing since device will enter STANDBY
                    instead of IDLE
    Workaround    : See new driver for details.

                    include the new power driver files PowerC2650.c, PowerCC2650_calibrateRCOSC.c,
                    and PowerCC2650_tirtos_power_policy.c and the utility files List.c and HwiP_tirtos.c.
                    If the PIN driver is not used and PIN_init() is not called, Power_init() must be called
                    for power management to function.

Issues fixed

    [PIN]  236: PIN driver allowed allocation/configuration of non-exisiting IOs on
                CC13xx 4x4 and 5x5 packages.
    [RF]   189: Added assert checks for out of range parameters and null pointers
    [RF]   243: Fixed driver hangs when receiving packets in sniff mode
    [RF]   223: CCS optimizations on "RF.c" module showed different behavior


Known Issues

    [PDM]  34: PDM driver does not support power management and only IAR toolchain.
    [I2C]  36: There's no check to see if the I2C bus is busy before issuing a tranfer.
    [UART] 146: There's no way to flush the UART RX FIFO.
                Possible bytes received will therefore remain in the RX FIFO through
                a UART_close()/UART_open() call sequence.
    [SPI]  161: If both SPI modules are used at once, and one transfer finishes
                before the other one, the SB_DISALLOW constraint is released
                causing the device to enter standby and thus aborting
                the other ongoing SPI module's transfer.
    [LCD]  235: When using LCD_bufferPrintString --> LCD_doBufferPrintString,
                there is no checking for whether the string will exceed the buffer size.
    [RF]   283: RF_waitCmd doesn't handle RF_cmdHandle wrap-around cases properly

    Summary       : Alpha version of PDM (Pulse Density Modulation) driver
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PDM
    Release Notes : This is the first release of the PDM driver.
                                    It has the following known issues:
                                        - Does not support power management.
                                          SB_DISALLOW and IDLE_PD_DISALLOW constraints are set
                                          by driver when operating, while only SB_DISALLOW should
                                          be required.
                                        - Only IAR is supported as toolchain.
                                        - Very limited test coverage!
                                        - Board file content currently hardcoded in PDMCC26XX.c.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 76

    Summary       : Callback for I2C, UART, PIN, and SPI drivers moved from HWI to SWI context.
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : I2C, UART, PIN, and SPI
    Release Notes : When the drivers are operating in CALLBACK mode, the callbacks
                                    are now done in SWI context rather than HWI context.
                                    As a result, all the hardware attributes have new fields
                                    in order to be able to also set the SWI priority.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 108

    Summary       : The PIN driver now supports setting HWI and SWI interrupt priorities
    Severity      : Major

                                    priorities through the board file by specifying a hardware attributes structure.
                                    The HWI and SWI priorities apply to all pins.
    Workaround    : N/A



Item 237

    Summary       : Power management moved from kernel to separate driver.
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : All
    Release Notes : The handling of power management has been moved from the kernel
                                    to a separate Power driver.
                                    This should not impact the application, except if the drivers
                                    are included as source code (instead of prebuilt library),
                                    include the new power driver files PowerC2650.c, PowerCC2650_calibrateRCOSC.c,
                                    and PowerCC2650_tirtos_power_policy.c and the utility files List.c and HwiP_tirtos.c.
                                    If the PIN driver is not used and PIN_init() is not called, Power_init() must be called
                                    for power management to function.

Issue [36]

    Summary       : There's no check to see if the I2C bus is busy before issuing a tranfer.
    Severity      : Medium
    Affected Comp : I2C
    Description   : The I2C driver does not check if the I2C bus is busy before issuing
                                    an I2C transfer.
    Workaround    : N/A

Issue [146]

    Summary       : UART bytes remain in RX FIFO through UART_close()/UART_open()
    Severity      : Medium
    Affected Comp : I2C
    Description   : There's no way to flush the UART RX FIFO.
                                    Possible bytes received will therefore remain in the RX FIFO through
                                    a UART_close()/UART_open() call sequence.
    Workaround    : Read and discard the RX FIFO bytes as part of UART_open()

Issue [161]

    Summary       : Using both SPI modules at the same time can cause errors.
    Severity      : Medium
    Affected Comp : I2C
    Description   : If both SPI modules are used at once, and one transfer finishes
                                    before the other one, the SB_DISALLOW constraint is released
                                    causing the device to enter standby and thus aborting
                                    the other ongoing SPI module's transfer.
    Workaround    : The driver should not check the same flag when setting/releasing
                                    the SB_DISALLOW constraint. Each module should check its own flag.

Issue [235]

    Summary       : LCD driver does not check size of string to print.
    Severity      : Medium
    Affected Comp : LCD
    Description   : When using LCD_bufferPrintString --> LCD_doBufferPrintString,
                                    there is no checking for whether the string will exceed the buffer size.
    Workaround    : These functions must check the size of the string and return an
                                    error if the size exceeds the buffer size

Issue [283]

    Summary       : RF_waitCmd doesn't handle RF_cmdHandle wrap-around cases properly.

2. Bug Item Details
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 149

    Summary       : Powerup request while powering down could cause lockup
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Powerdown sequence was not ordered in an optimal way.
    Workaround    : Reorder powerdown sequence.

Item 153

    Summary       : Asymmetric implementation of external flash interface
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : SensorTag
    Release Notes : The external flash interface for SensorTag/LaunchPad has inconsistencies in the
                    way open and closed are used. In the case the flash verification fails, open
                    returns false but does not close the PIN and SPI-driver it has opened. This
                    forces the application to close even if open fails which is inconsistent and
                    confusing.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 155

    Summary       : SmartRF06EB board files should be C99 compilant
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : Board files
    Release Notes : Board files updated to be C99 compliant, i.e. format is:
                        .fxnTablePtr = &UARTCC26XX_fxnTable
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 176

    Summary       : There was no check for advanced commands in rx
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Code has been added to check for both rx and rx advanced commands

Item 178

    Summary       : Possible multiple execution of Hwi_restore() in RF_postCmd
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : At the end of RF_postCmd there was a possibillity that multiple
                    Hwi_restore() calls were made
    Workaround    : Code restructure and removal of unneccesary Hwi_restore().

Item 180

    Summary       : CryptoCC26XX_init() is missing in the code part of doxygen description
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : CryptoCC26XX
    Release Notes : CryptoCC26XX_init() function call included in doxygen code.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 196

    Summary       : LaunchPad flash driver
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : Launch Pad
    Release Notes : A flash driver for the Macronics flash is included to support OAD.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 197

    Summary       : Update driver doxygen wrt HWI priorities
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : Drivers
    Release Notes : Updated the driver doxygen to reflect that only HWI interrupt priorities
                    in the range 1 << 5 to 7 << 5 are to be used.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 206

    Summary       : No callback if RF_abortCmd was called and radio was off
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Function handling callbacks was only accessible when radio was powered on.
                    This caused callbacks to not trigger if the radio
                    was powered off.
    Workaround    : Make callback function available when radio is powered down.

Item 207

    Summary       : RF_waitCmd did not cover all possible wait situations
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : Waiting on aborted/stopped/cancelled commands had tiing issues.
    Workaround    : Add flag bit in command structure to signal that command had been aborted.

Item 110

    Summary       : SPI driver used unsave reset mechanism.
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : SPICC26XXDMA
    Release Notes : In SPI_transferCancel(...) there was a call to HapiResetPeripheral(...)
                    which is not safe.
                    Instead, we've implemented a safe TX FIFO flush function to avoid
                    having to call the unsafe HapiResetPerhiperal(...) function.

    Workaround    : Remove the call to HapiResetPeripheral(...) and replace it with the new
                    function SPICC26XXDMA_flushTxFifo(...).

Item 120

    Summary       : The standby constraint was set too late in SPI_transfer(...)
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : SPICC26XXDMA
    Release Notes : In SPI_transfer(...) the standby constraint was set after the SSI module
                    was enabled, which in certain instances could cause problems.
                    Now the standby contraint is set before the SSI module is enabled.
    Workaround    : In the function SPI_transfer(...) move line:
                    threadSafeConstraintSet((uint32_t)(transaction->txBuf));
                    to before:
                    SSIEnable(hwAttrs->baseAddr);

Item 122

    Summary       : Missing Power.h include in CryptoCC26xx.h
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : CryptoCC26XX
    Release Notes : The CryptoCC26XX.c file is missing the following include:
                    #include <ti/sysbios/family/arm/cc26xx/Power.h>
    Workaround    : Add the following line to CryptoCC26XX.h

2. Bug Item Details
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Item 2

    Summary       : Add intPriority to all drivers HwAttrs
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : CryptoCC26XX, UDMACC26XX, I2CCC26XX, SPICC26XXDMA, UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : All the drivers used default (low) priority. It is now possible
                    to set a non-default priority.
                    Note: the PIN driver is still using the default priority.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 6

    Summary       : Make RTOS board file for CC13xx 7x7 on SmartRF06EB
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : Board files
    Release Notes : A CC1310EM_7ID_7793 folder with Board files for SmartRF06EB is added.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 23

    Summary       : New radio driver
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : RF
    Release Notes : A new RF driver is added to allow control of the CC26xx/CC13xx radio.
                    This driver should be considered an Alpha release.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 39

    Summary       : Peripheral drivers can terminate pin setup too early
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PINCC26XX
    Release Notes : PIN_UNASSIGNED was equal to PIN_TERMINATE.
                    If an application removed pin usage by setting it to PIN_UNASSIGNED via board
                    file (e.g. Board_UART_TX), the PIN_open failed if the removed PIN was not the
                    last one to be parsed.
                    The update is using different values for PIN_UNASSIGNED and PIN_TERMINATE.
    Workaround    : Avoid PIN_UNASSIGNED in the middle of PIN_Configs and make sure this is true
                    for PIN_Configs in drivers too.

Item 47

    Summary       : Add information about which SPI data rates are supported in SPI driver
    Severity      : Minor

    Workaround    : N/A

Item 57

    Summary       : UART driver doxygen update
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : Description updated to: "Application thread should typically either issue
                    another read after UART_read() times out to continue reception, or call
                    UART_close() to end reception"
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 67

    Summary       : 5x5 Board file - UART not working on CCS due to DATA_SECTION bug
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX, Board files
    Release Notes : uartCC26XXObjects replaced with uartCC26XXHWAttrs in DATA_SECTION.
    Workaround    : In ti\boards\SRF06EB\CC2650EM_5XD\Board.c replace
                    #pragma DATA_SECTION(uartCC26XXObjects, ".const:uartCC26XXObjects")
                    with
                    #pragma DATA_SECTION(uartCC26XXHWAttrs, ".const:uartCC26XXHWAttrs")

Item 68

    Summary       : Pin handle and state should be part of driver objects in I2C and UART drivers
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX, I2CCC26XX
    Release Notes : PIN_State and PIN_Handle moved into UARTCC26XX_Object and I2CCC26XX_Object
                    so that application can access pin handle and modify these
                    PIN values when the driver is inactive.
    Workaround    : None

Item 71

    Summary       : SPIDMA - late uDMA interrupt clearing might cause error
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : SPICC26XXDMA
    Release Notes : At high optimization, the interrupt was not cleared before interrupt handler
                    exited, causing interrupt handler to be called twice. Now interrupts are not
                    handled until both the TX and RX DMA channels have completed.
                    This also ensures that the interrupt is properly cleared before exiting handler.
    Workaround    : In SPICC26XXDMA_hwiFxn replace the check:
                    if (UDMACC26XX_channelDone(object->udmaHandle, hwAttrs->txChannelBitMask) {
                    with:
                    if (UDMACC26XX_channelDone(object->udmaHandle, hwAttrs->txChannelBitMask) &&
                    UDMACC26XX_channelDone(object->udmaHandle, hwAttrs->rxChannelBitMask)) {

Item 104

    Summary       : UARTCC26XX - 'errStatus' might be used uninitialized
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : Static analysis uncovered a potential problem in UART hwi.
    Workaround    : Make sure to initialize the errStatus in UARTCC26XX_hwiIntFxn:
                    unsigned long errStatus = UART_OK;

Item 106

    Summary       : Need widely compatible Board files for ST
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : Board files
    Release Notes : New SensorTag board files is added. See ti\boards\SensorTag.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 109

    Summary       : Many comments references SmartRF06EB, should be sensortag.
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : Board files
    Release Notes : SRF06EB_* comments updated to SENSORTAG_*.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 111

    Summary       : UART driver releases SB_DISALLOW if RX/TX completes while another TX/RX is ongoing
    Severity      : Blocker
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : The UART driver is now using to separate constraint flags, one for RX and one
                    for TX.
    Workaround    : The application might use an extra _setContraint(Power_SB_Disallow) during UART
                    operation to make sure that the device is not going to standby.

Item 3

    Summary       : LCD_close(...) does not close the SPI channel.
    Severity      : Blocker
    Affected Comp : LCDDogm1286
    Release Notes : The LCD_close(...) function did not close the SPI channel,
                    resulting in the user being unable to open the SPI driver
                    for the same channel used by the LCD, after the LCD driver
                    had been used once.
                    This has now been fixed by also closing the SPI driver
                    in LCD_close(...)
    Workaround    : Add to LCD_close(...) this line:
                    /* Close SPI */
                    SPI_close(object->spiHandle);

Item 9

    Summary       : Add doxygen documentation on how customers can minimize leakage in SPI driver
    Severity      : Minor
    Affected Comp : SPICC26XXDMA
    Release Notes : External hardware connected on the SPI, i.e. SPI host/slave, might have configured
                    a pull on one or more of the SPI lines. Dependent on the hardware, it might conflict
                    with the pull used for the CC26XX SPI.
                    To avoid increased leakage and ensure the lowest possible power consumption
                    when the SPI is inactive, the application must configure a matching pull
                    on the SPI IOs. An example of how this can be done is now included in the doxygen
                    documentation for the SPI driver
    Workaround    : After having opened the SPI driver, configure the desired pull (below shows example
                    for MISO):
                    // Get pinHandle
                    pinHandle = ((SPICC26XX_Object *)spiHandle->object)->pinHandle;
                    // Get miso pin id
                    misoPinId = ((SPICC26XX_HWAttrs *)spiHandle->hwAttrs)->misoPin;
                    // Apply low power sleep pull config for MISO
                    PIN_setConfig(pinHandle, PIN_BM_PULLING, PIN_PULLUP | misoPinId);

Item 11

    Summary       : PIN driver must support CC13xx which has one less IO
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PINCC26XX
    Release Notes : CC13xx does not have DIO_0, so the PIN driver now does not allow
                    application to allocate this PIN if the device is a CC13xx.
                    However the application should be able to allocate all the other pins
                    which for a CC13xx 7x7 is DIO_1 to DIO_30.
    Workaround    : None

Item 46

    Summary       : DUT cannot enter standby after a blocking UART_read(...) times out
    Severity      : Critical
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : If the application calls UART_read(...) in blocking mode, and the
                    read times out, the SB_DISALLOW is never released. As a result
                    the application is not able to enter standby.
    Workaround    : Add the following lines to UART_read(...) when the timeout occurs:

                    /* Disable RX interrupts */
                    UARTIntDisable(hwAttrs->baseAddr, UART_INT_OE | UART_INT_BE | UART_INT_PE |

Item 49

    Summary       : PIN driver should allocate pin used for external 32kHz LF clock
    Severity      : Major
    Affected Comp : PINCC26XX
    Release Notes : There's now support in CCFG to use an external IO as source for the 32 kHz
                    LF clock source. The pin driver now also reserves this pin, thus assuring that
                    the application cannot allocate this IO for other purposes.

Item 5960

    Summary       : UARTCC26XX missing flow-control
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P1 - Enhancement
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : The UART for CC26XX has flow control support. Flow control
                    is enabled by assigning valid IOID for the CTS and RTS pins
                    in the UARTCC26XX_HWAttrs.
    Workaround    : None

Item 6074

    Summary       : Board files should include RFp.n comment for pins
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P2 - Normal
    Affected Comp : Board files
    Release Notes : The board files for SRF06EB are updated to include RF
                    connector information, e.g. LED3 for CC2650EM_4XS:
                        #define Board_LED3    IOID_5    // RF1.2
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 6540

    Summary       : All drivers must set/release SB disallow constraint
                    thread-safely.
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P1 - Critical
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX, SPIXX26XX and I2CCC26XX.
    Release Notes : Some of the drivers was releasing power constraints in both
                    task context and hwi context. Since the one in task context
                    did not release in a thread safe manner, the risk of
                    releasing the power constraint twice was present. This
                    update ensures that each driver disable it's hwi before
                    setting and releasing the constraint and also holds a flag
                    to keep track of it's current constraint setting.
    Workaround    : None

Item 6603

    Summary       : [UART] timeout description needs update
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P2 - Normal
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : The doxygen documentation is updated with information
                    regarding timeout.
                    Summary - The timeout can only be specified for
                    blocking mode. If a timeout occurs during a read, the
                    number of bytes received will be returned and the
                    UART_Object.status will be set to UART_TIMED_OUT.
                    If a timeout occurs during a write, an UART_ERROR will be
                    returned and the UART_Object.status will be set to
                    UART_TIMED_OUT. All bytes that are not transmitted, will
                    be flushed.
    Workaround    : N/A

Item 6604

    Summary       : [UART] align timeout behavior with other error behavior
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P1 - Normal
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : The standby disallow constraint is released after timeout
                    as well to allow the device to enter standby.
    Workaround    : None

Item 6655

    Summary       : [UART] - hwi must check UART_INT_TX not object->writeSize
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P1 - Normal
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : The TX FIFO empty clock event computation assumed that the
                    UART_INT_TX event triggered the write, but the hwi was
                    checking object->writeSize. So if another UART interrupt
                    triggered the hwi and the last write bytes are fitted into
                    the TX FIFO, the computation would be wrong and the TX FIFO
                    empty function would hang, waiting for the UART busy flag
                    to be deasserted.
                    By checking both UART_INT_TX flag and object->writeSize in
                    the hwi, the computation is done correctly.
    Workaround    : None

Item 6661

    Summary       : [UART] - wrong estimation of TX FIFO Empty Clock time
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P1 - Normal
    Affected Comp : UARTCC26XX
    Release Notes : In some situations the timeout happened too early. The
                    mapping of the object->stopBits was not done correctly.
                    An extra byte was included in the TX FIFO Empty clock
                    event computation to get the correct mapping.
    Workaround    : None

Item 6729

    Summary       : SPI_control set CSn doesn't work if originally
                    PIN_UNASSIGNED.
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P2 - Normal
    Affected Comp : SPICC26XX
    Release Notes : The new assigned chip select pins is always configured with
                    input enabled and pull-up.
    Workaround    : None

Item 6730

    Summary       : Board.c should not hard-code IOIDs but always use eg
                    Board_SPI0_CSN.
    Fixed in      : 1_06_00
    Severity      : P1 - Normal
    Affected Comp : Board files
    Release Notes : By assigning Board_SPI0_CSN and Board_SPI1_CSN pins to
                    the chip select pins in the board source file, the customer
                    should only have to modify the header files when moving
                    the chip select pins to work with their design.
