## Example Summary

This application demonstrates how to use the SYS/BIOS Clock and Task modules in
C++ to create a real-time clock/calendar.

## Example Usage

* Run the application, the two Clock objects (`id 1` and `id 2`) current times'
within the program will be continuously output to the console.

## Application Design Details

* The C++ class object, Clock, is driven by a variety of SYS/BIOS objects: two
Clock objects, two Task objects, and an Idle object. Each SYS/BIOS object has
its own instantiation of the Clock.  When the Clock, Task, and Idle functions
execute, they call their clock's tick function, advancing the connected timer
by one second.

* Because the functions execute at different rates, the attache clocks also
advance at different rates.  For example, one of the Clock objects, `cl2`,
has a period of one second.  When `cl2` runs, it advances its timer by
one second. This results in an accurate clock.  On the other hand,
`cl0` runs with every pass through the idle loop.  Therefore, the number of
seconds passed for its attached timer indicates the time spent in the idle loop.

> See the projects' `main` function for more information on how the SYS/BIOS
objects are constructed.

> You can experiment with advancing Clock at different rates
by changing the `Clock::tick function`

> Some targets utilize the RTOS analyzer to output the Clock times as
`Log_info` events rather than using `System_printf`. To view the logs, open
`Tools->RTOS Analyzer->Printf and Error Logs` and switch to the `Live
Session` tab.
